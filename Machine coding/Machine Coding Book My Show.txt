- Make use case diagrams :

    • Make a box and write system name on top

    • Indentify actors 

    • Identify use cases : actions taken by actors : search for verbs in requirements

    • Add Associations : 
        • connect actors with use cases
        • Identify Inclusive use cases : break use cases into smaller use cases 
        • add extension use cases (usually ignored in mvp 1)
        • add generalisation/inheritance on actors  (modify Associations accordingly)



- Make class diagrams
    • Tag all the nouns in requirements : App, movies, shows, user, shows, registered user, ticket, theatre 
    • Tag all the nouns in assumptions : screen, guest user, language, genre 
    • make class for each noun and draw relationships btw them 
    • tricky, needs practise
